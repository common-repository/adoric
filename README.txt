An easy to use marketing solution for WordPress that lets you create popups to win more leads, and convert visitors into customers.

[Adoric](https://adoric.com/) is an easy-to-use WordPress marketing solution that lets you convert your website traffic into leads and sales. And without you writing a single line of code!

Adoric comes with a popup builder you can use to create optin-forms to capture your visitors emails and, thus, grow your mailing list.

You can either create one from scratch using our intuitive [drag-and-drop editor](https://adoric.com/features/drag-and-drop-builder/). Or just pick any of our [templates](https://adoric.com/templates) and customize it to your heart&#39;s content. We&#39;ve got over 800 templates.

And you don&#39;t have to worry about annoying visitors with your popup opt-in forms. This is because Adoric makes it possible for you to target the [right audience](https://adoric.com/features/audience-targeting/) at the right time.

We built Adoric for eCommerce entrepreneurs, affiliate marketers, publishers, agencies, and anyone looking to achieve marketing success online.

To make this a reality, we&#39;ve built lots of tools into Adoric. They are:

- Drag and drop builder for creating and editing high-converting [popup](https://adoric.com/templates?layout=boxes), [slide-in](https://adoric.com/templates?layout=sliders), or [floating bar](https://adoric.com/templates?layout=bars) campaigns.
- Cart abandonment solutions
- Conversion optimization solutions
- Web personalization solutions
- ESP integration of your choice
- Smart analytics

**Drag and Drop Editor**

Creating opt-in popups just became easier, thanks to our intuitive drag and drop editor.

What&#39;s really cool about our design editor is that you don&#39;t need to know a lick about coding to use it. Neither do you need to be a pro designer.

It comes with all the tools you will ever need to create an eye-catching, high-converting campaign:

- [10,000 free graphic elements](https://adoric.com/features/graphic-elements/) to spice up your designs
- Unlimited GIFs, powered by GIPHY
- Campaign positioning. Make your campaigns appear wherever you like on your website: top, bottom, bottom-right, top-left, etc.
- Mobile editor for making your campaigns mobile-responsive
- Multi-step option for creating [2-step campaigns](https://adoric.com/features/multi-step-campaign/).
- Unlimited upload for uploading and adding images to your campaign.

Thankfully, you don&#39;t have to create campaigns from scratch. Just head over to our template library and pick any campaign template that pleases you best: popup, slide-in, or floating bar.

**Cart Abandonment Solutions**

Are your visitors abandoning their carts without completing the checkout process? This is understandably frustrating.

But don&#39;t worry, Adoric can help.

Here are a couple of [smart solutions](https://adoric.com/solutions/cart-abandonment) Adoric puts at your disposal to combat cart abandonment:

- [Exit-intent popup](https://adoric.com/features/exit-intent-pop-ups/)for capturing the attention of users the instant they attempt to leave your website.
- [Lucky wheel](https://adoric.com/features/spin-to-win-coupon-wheel-popup/) coupon pop-ups for enticing visitors with coupons, and thus make them shop longer on your website.

**Conversion Optimization Solutions**

Are you getting tons of traffic, but little to no conversions? It&#39;s time to fix that with the following tools:

- [Countdown timer](https://adoric.com/features/countdown-timer/) to create a sense of urgency with your visitors to make them act promptly, thus improving your conversion rate.
- [A/B testing](https://adoric.com/features/a-b-testing/) lets you find out what&#39;s working and what&#39;s not. That way, you can make better decisions.
- Audience targeting and [smart triggers](https://adoric.com/features/triggers/) to show your campaigns to the right people at the right time.


**Web Personalization Solution**

Personalizing your visitors browsing or shopping experience will go a long way in impacting your bottom lines positively.

Hence the reason we built a robust [product recommendation](https://adoric.com/public/solutions/recommendations) feature into Adoric. It lets you recommend relevant products (and even content) to your visitors based on their browsing preferences.

**ESP Integration of Your Choice**

Adoric supports plug-and-play integration with all major Email Service Providers: MailChimp, Aweber, Hubspot, Getresponse, you name them.

But if you don&#39;t use an ESP, you can save captured leads right within your Adoric account.

**Analytics**

What&#39;s the point of running a campaign if you can&#39;t track it&#39;s performance. Adoric analytic tool allows you to seamlessly track your campaign&#39;s impressions, clicks, and CTR.
